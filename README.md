### 01 Polidrom

Given a string; you need to write a function that allows you to return true if the string is a palindrome, 
and false otherwise. In this case, spaces and punctuation marks must be taken into account.

It is required to write a function that displays numbers from 1 to n to the console, 
where n is an integer that the function takes as a parameter, with the following conditions:

#### output

buzz output instead of multiples of 5;
fizzbuzz output instead of multiples of both 3 and 5.
Example

// buzz



### 03 Anagram
This is the name of a word that contains all the letters of another word in the same number, but in a different order.
